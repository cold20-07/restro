#### Test Results
```
29 passed, 1 warning in 5.42s
```

All integration tests pass successfully, verifying:
- Component structure and rendering
- State management functionality
- Navigation and routing
- Error handling and loading states
- Layout and styling consistency

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Architecture
