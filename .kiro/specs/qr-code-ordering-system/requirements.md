# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant QR-code ordering system designed for the restaurant industry. The system enables restaurants to provide self-service, dine-in ordering through QR codes placed at tables, while offering restaurant owners a comprehensive dashboard to manage orders and menus in real-time. The platform operates as a SaaS solution where multiple restaurants can maintain their own private dashboards and menus with complete data isolation.
